# GameJamSpooky
DaHoon Games first game ever, made for a itch.io gamejam

All graphics made by me in Blender (I only just started learning Blender).
Game made in unity - both programmers only just started with Unity ;)
Gameplay is a little boring, but still proud of our little project which was completed in less than 3 days!
